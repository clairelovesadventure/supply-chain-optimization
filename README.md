from src.algorithms.vrp_solver import VRPSolver
from src.visualization.performance import PerformanceVisualizer

# Create logistics optimization model
optimizer = LogisticsOptimizer()
solution = optimizer.optimize_supply_chain()

# Solve vehicle routing problem
vrp_solver = VRPSolver()
routes = vrp_solver.solve_vrp()

# Visualize results
visualizer = PerformanceVisualizer()
visualizer.plot_optimization_results(solution)
```
